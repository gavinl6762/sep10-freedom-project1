# SEP10 Freedom Project
# Entry1: Deciding on Project
#### 10/13/25

The topic I wanted to do on the project is chess because it is something I am really passionate about and really enjoy doing on my free-time. Additionally, I decided to choose chess because I want others to enjoy chess like the way I do and cheating in chess. I considered to make this project about chess and how it helps individually. The articles that helped me with making this idea is: https://debsie.com and https://chessnutech.com . 

# Engineering Design Process
As for right now, I'm thinking about how **chess technology may help others** in chess or how it can **resolve problems**. Then, I'll want to research and look at websites to learn more about the problem.

# Skills
Some skills ive learn about while doing this blog was **researching** and **deep thinking**.

#### Researching
I learned that instead of looking through the internet looking for good websites too learn more about the topic, I skimmed through the websites titles and the heading to look deeper into them to not waste time.
#### Deep Thinking
I had to think into a topic that would affect people in the chess world and had to think about how I could create technology that will helpresolve the problem.
